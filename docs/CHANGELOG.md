# Changelog

## [1.9.11]

- Options page: merged "Test Connection" into the Organization ID section (next to Save Settings) and dropped the standalone "Test Your Settings" section
- Options page: button text now vertically centered (inline-flex + line-height reset; was inheriting body's 1.6 line-height)
- Options page: Date format and Time format now sit side-by-side in a two-column grid instead of stacked
- Mirrored prior `chrome/options.html` CSS tweaks (page width 800px, button padding, `.section h3` margins) into `firefox/options.html` — Firefox copy had fallen behind

## [1.9.10]

- Popup org-ID error now reads "Failed to obtain organization ID: Please set this value in Options." with "Options" as a clickable link that opens the options page
- Lowercased "Claude.ai" → "claude.ai" in all user-facing strings (popup, browse, options) to match the actual domain

## [1.9.9]

- Removed the "Organization ID not configured" setup banner from the popup — org ID is auto-detected from claude.ai on every export action, so the banner was redundant
- Updated the fallback error message when org ID detection fails: now suggests opening the popup from a claude.ai tab instead of pointing at the removed setup link

## [1.9.8]

- Markdown export now includes the `truncated` flag in the metadata block (when present in the conversation data)
- Markdown export now shows file attachment metadata per message (`file_name`, `file_size`, `file_type`) — not just `extracted_content`. File attachments render as `### Attachment: <name> _(size, type)_`; pasted content keeps the legacy `### Pasted` label.

## [1.9.7]

- Reorganized the browse settings dropdown: Date and Time format toggles moved to the options page; their slot now holds a "Backup/Restore Database" item with a hover submenu (Backup / Restore)
- Backup & Restore logic moved into shared `utils.js` so the options page and browse dropdown use one implementation
- Options page gains a "Date & Time Format" section

## [1.9.6]

- Added an "Advanced Options" link to the browse page settings dropdown (between Time and Test connection) — opens the options page, making Backup & Restore reachable directly from the browse view

## [1.9.5]

- Added Backup & Restore to the options page — download all extension data (model snapshots, export history, preferences) to a JSON file and restore it later
- Survives uninstall/reinstall, and lets you move data between browsers, devices, or extension builds (e.g. store version ↔ GitHub build)

## [1.9.4]

- Browse table's Model column now shows each chat's original (first-seen) model from the snapshot data, falling back to the current/inferred model when no snapshot exists
- Bounced chats (original model differs from current) get a `→` marker with a tooltip showing "Originally X, now Y"
- Model column sorting follows the displayed (original) model

_Published_

## [1.9.3]

- Snapshot each conversation's current model to `chrome.storage.local` whenever the conversation list is fetched (browse page load or popup "Export All") — preserves the model before a chat gets bounced to a new one on model retirement
- Records first-seen model, current model, and a change history per conversation; only the raw API model is stored, never an inferred guess

## [1.9.2]

- Added Vitest test harness for `utils.js` (52 tests covering export logic, model name parsing, artifact extraction)
- Extracted model utilities (`formatModelName`, `getModelBadgeClass`, `DEFAULT_MODEL_TIMELINE`) out of `content.js`/`browse.js` into shared `utils.js`
- Doc-linked the Anthropic model-ID schema in code comments

## [1.9.1]

- Fixed Model column header alignment with badge text on browse page
- Single-conversation "Export All" no longer wraps the file in a ZIP
- Progress modal now resets bar/stats/text on each open instead of carrying over from the previous run
- Progress modal closes immediately on Cancel instead of waiting for the in-flight batch
- Artifact extraction now filters by `tool_use.name === 'artifacts'` so bash/web_search/repl tool calls can't slip through as fake artifacts
- Fixed model name display when version has no minor (e.g. `claude-opus-4-20250514` now renders as "Claude Opus 4" instead of "Claude Opus 4.20250514")
- Light mode contrast pass: deeper model badge colors, View button border, refined palette aligned with popup
- Click the org ID row in the browse settings dropdown to copy it to the clipboard
