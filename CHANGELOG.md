# Changelog

## [1.9.3]

- Snapshot each conversation's current model to `chrome.storage.local` whenever the conversation list is fetched (browse page load or popup "Export All") — preserves the model before a chat gets bounced to a new one on model retirement
- Records first-seen model, current model, and a change history per conversation; only the raw API model is stored, never an inferred guess

## [1.9.2]

- Added Vitest test harness for `utils.js` (52 tests covering export logic, model name parsing, artifact extraction)
- Extracted model utilities (`formatModelName`, `getModelBadgeClass`, `DEFAULT_MODEL_TIMELINE`) out of `content.js`/`browse.js` into shared `utils.js`
- Doc-linked the Anthropic model-ID schema in code comments

## [1.9.1]

- Fixed Model column header alignment with badge text on browse page
- Single-conversation "Export All" no longer wraps the file in a ZIP
- Progress modal now resets bar/stats/text on each open instead of carrying over from the previous run
- Progress modal closes immediately on Cancel instead of waiting for the in-flight batch
- Artifact extraction now filters by `tool_use.name === 'artifacts'` so bash/web_search/repl tool calls can't slip through as fake artifacts
- Fixed model name display when version has no minor (e.g. `claude-opus-4-20250514` now renders as "Claude Opus 4" instead of "Claude Opus 4.20250514")
- Light mode contrast pass: deeper model badge colors, View button border, refined palette aligned with popup
- Click the org ID row in the browse settings dropdown to copy it to the clipboard
